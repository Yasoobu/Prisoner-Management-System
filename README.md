# Prisoner-Management-System
This is a web application made in ASP.NET for prisoner management.

To run this application, you need to install:
-Visual Studio, preferrably 2015 or above
-Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
-Any html5 supported web browser, preferably Google Chrome

After installing the above menstioned softwares, open the solution in visual studio. Firstly change the connection string to the connection string of your pc.
Press Ctrl + F5 to run the application.

The user can login to the system as a Jailor or Jail Officer. Both have different functionalities as they have different jurisdictions.
A dashboard opens after logging in where you can see a list of prisoners and their details who are currently in the jail. A new prisoner can also be added.
Clicking on visitor info will open another screen which shows the visitors who are currently visiting prisoners and how many more visits they can do in a month.

A prisoner's medical record can also be entered along with their medication and allergies. A jail officer can also request transfer of a prisoner. 
This request can either be approved or declined from the Jailer's interface.
Jailer's interface also has a little more options than the Jail Officer because Jailer is senior to Jail Officer.
